# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview
Our boss, V. Isualize, has given us a new objective to apply our Python skills and Pandas DataFrames knowledge. She wants an overall summary of ride-sharing data sorted by the city type (rural, suburban, urban) and a graph of the weekly free for each city type. These outputs will help V. and others in upper management make well-informed decisions in regards to the ride-sharing company.


## Results

This summary includes the total number of rides, drivers and fares as well as the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver for each city type. The most immediately noticeable difference between the city types is the volume of rides. Urban cities have 13 times the amount of rides as rural cities and almost 3 times as many as suburban. An effect of this volume is that the average fares are lower for urban cities due to the ample supply. Meanwhile, rural and suburban average fares are higher because there are fewer drivers and less overall demand. An interesting note is that suburban rides only had about 38% of the volume as urban rides, but it garnered almost 50% as much in total fares. This suggests that suburban rides are more profitable while still maintaining a decent volume, unlike rural rides.

## Summary
Given the data analysis provided above, we would suggest that PyBer aims to make urban rides more profitable by narrowly increasing the average fare. We also suggest that the suburban market expands to allow for more rides and drivers. PyBer may also need to reduce the number of drivers in urban cities to more closely match the demand.
